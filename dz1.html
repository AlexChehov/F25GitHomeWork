                    <div class="description">Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is the youngest of four sons.
                         His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman before retiring from the force and going to work as a foods wholesaler.
                         His mother, Tamara Lee (n√©e Stewart) worked in retail sales. Reynolds has two brothers who work in law enforcement in British Columbia, one of whom followed his father into the RCMP.
                          His paternal grandfather, Chester Reynolds, was a farmer who represented Stettler in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1940 to 1944. Reynolds has Irish and Scottish ancestry, and was raised in the Roman Catholic Church in Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood.
                          He has been involved in acting since age thirteen. He graduated from Kitsilano Secondary School in 1994, which he attended with actor Joshua Jackson.[12] Reynolds played small roles in a number of television series, but became discouraged and quit acting at age 19 to enroll at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. 
                          A few months later he ran into fellow actor Chris William Martin, who convinced him to try again and move with him to Los Angeles

                    <div class="description">Reynolds began dating singer Alanis Morissette in 2002, and they announced their engagement in June 2004. In February 2007, representatives for the pair announced they had mutually decided to end their engagement. Morissette said her album Flavors of Entanglement was created out of her grief after the split, and the song "Torch" was written about Reynolds.

                        Soon after the end of his relationship with Morissette in 2007, Reynolds began dating actress Scarlett Johansson. They announced their engagement in May 2008, and married on September 27 of that year, in a private ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia.[88] On December 14, 2010, they announced their separation. Reynolds filed for divorce in Los Angeles on December 23, and Johansson filed her response simultaneously. The divorce was finalized on July 1, 2011.
                        
                        Reynolds first met Blake Lively in early 2010 while filming Green Lantern, in which they co-starred. They began dating in October 2011 and married on September 9, 2012, at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. In the wake of civil rights protests in 2020, Reynolds publicly apologized and expressed deep regret for using that venue due to its association with slavery; he and Lively renewed their vows at home in New York. The couple have three daughters: James, born December 2014, Inez, born September 2016, and Betty in 2019.
                        
                        The family reside in Pound Ridge, New York. Reynolds and Lively are close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who named the characters in her song "Betty" after their daughters.
                        
                        Reynolds has openly spoken about his lifelong struggle with anxiety, noting in 2018 that he carried out many interviews in the character of Deadpool to alleviate his fears.He became a U.S. citizen c. 2018.
                        
                        On November 26, 2021, Governor General Mary Simon awarded Reynolds a Governor General's Performing Arts Award to recognize his philanthropic work and significant contributions to the cultural life of Canada. Sandra Bullock, Morena Baccarin, Michael J. Fox, and Hugh Jackman made pre-recorded speeches in support of, and to congratulate Reynolds on the award.
                        
                        In the aftermath of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Reynolds and Lively pledged to "match up" to $1 million for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.
                        
                        In March 2022, Lively and Reynolds made another donation, amounting to $500,000 to Water First, to provide indigenous people in Canada with clean water and training to young people to become professional as technicians in environmental issues.</div>
